# Getting Started with NPM
This repo is meant to help you get started using NPM to install
and use JavaScript libraries. By the time you are done, you should know how to:
- start a new NPM project
- add JavaScript libraries to that project
- run those projects on your local machine

## How to use this repo
Each step of this project has a corresponding directory (`./step_1`, `./step_2`, etc). Your job
is to read the `README.md` inside of each step and complete the steps listed.

## Requirements
In order to complete this project, you'll need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed first.
You should have installed that at the beginning of the course during machine set up. You can double-check
that things are installed correctly by running the following command from a terminal:
```npm --version```.

The particular version doesn't really matter, but be sure that the terminal doesn't complain about the 
command not being found. *If you're on windows, make sure you're running the command inside of a WSL shell,
or if you don't have that installed a "Git for Bash" shell. On Mac OS and Linux, any shell should do fine.


## Get Going!
Now, head on over to [Step 1](./step_1/README.md) and start hacking!
