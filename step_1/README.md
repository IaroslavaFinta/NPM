# Lesson 1: JavaScript Libraries

By the end of this step, you should understand how to:
- use CDN libraries to add JavaScript libraries to vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript Projects
- create a new NPM project
- search for JavaScript libraries to use in that project
- install and use those JavaScript libraries

## Part I: CDN
Up until now, you've been including a single JavaScript file in your
projects by using a `<script>` tag. If you want to use JavaScript
libraries, you can add more `<script>` tags to include them as global
variables. 

Say you want to create a simple page that displays a random name every 
time you reload the page. One library that will help you do that is 
[Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/).

The method `faker.name.firstName()` will generate a random name each time it's run. 

In order to add `Faker` to your page, you'll need to include it via [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/). The simple explanation is that a CDN a way to make content available to webpages in a convenient way. One easy way to find libraries exposed using a CDN is to search for them on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries).

### Task 1
1. Go to [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries) and search for "Faker".
2. Click on the "Copy Script Tag" (</>) icon. 
3. Paste the copied code into the appropriate place in ./task_1/index.html
4. Preview the page and refresh. Notice how the name keeps changing! 

### Solution
You can find the solution on branch [task_1_solution](https://github.com/edwin-fsa/npm-getting-started/tree/task_1_solution)

## Part II: NPM Projects
In modern projects, instead of using CDNs, we'll use NPM to create projects. Thus, before we can recreate the above
(albeit simple) app using NPM packages, we need to take a detour to talk briefly about NPM itself.

To create a NPM project, you need to call `npm init`. Passing the `-y` flag will choose some sane defaults for you.

### Task 2
Create a new project named `random-names` using the following commands:
```
mkdir -p task_2/random-names
cd task_2/random-names
npm init -y
```
If done successfully, you should see that a new file named [./task_2/random-names/package.json](./task_2/random-names/package.json)
```json
{
  "name": "random-names",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

This JSON file describes our package. For now, the most important parts are the `name` and the `scripts` sections, which tell us the name
of the project as well as scripts that can be run respectively. 

You can run scripts by using the command `npm run <script name>`, replacing `<script name>` with the keys of the `scripts` object. So for example,
you can run `yarn run test` from inside of the [./task_2/random-names](./task_2/random-names) directory to see the Error message "Error: no test specified" printed to your console.

### Solution
You can find the solution on branch [task_2_solution](https://github.com/edwin-fsa/npm-getting-started/tree/task_2_solution)


## Part III: NPM Libraries
We still need to learn quite a few concepts before we can make a web app that mirrors the functionality of the app we made in part 1. For now,
let's create a console version of the app. That is, running `npm run` will print a new random name the console.

To get the starter code, simply commit your current changes (if you haven't already) and merge the `random-names-starter` branch into this one:
```
git merge random-names-starter
```

You'll notice a few changes:
- We added `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` file. This is needed in order to use modern import syntax (which we haven't talked about yet)
- We've also added a `"start": "node ./src/index.js"` key/value pair to our `scripts` section. This is how we'll run our app.
- There is now a file, [./task_2/random-names/src/index.js](./task_2/random-names/src/index.js). This is doing the same job as our `script` tags in our HTML; more on these later

### Task 3
Before this app will work, we'll need to install faker using npm.

1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) and search for "faker"
2. Choose the second option named "@faker-js/faker"
3. On the right side of the page, you'll see a section called "install". Copy that command and run it in a terminal in your [./task_2/random-names](./task_2/random-names) directory.
4. Run your app a few times by running `npm run start`. Notice again, you see random names showing up!
